**Overall Style & Tone**: Fast-paced animation in a clean, modern style with dark backgrounds (#141413) for immersive focus, accented by warm terracotta highlights (#CC785C) on success elements. Music: Upbeat electronic track starting chaotic (glitchy synths) and transitioning to smooth, confident rhythm (inspired by synthwave with subtle orchestral swells). Voiceover (VO): Witty, relatable male narrator in a calm, enthusiastic tone—think a trusted dev buddy, not a sales pitch. Font: Styrene A for on-screen text, crisp and bold. Target: Developers on LinkedIn/Twitter. Length: 45 seconds. CTA Link: anthropic.com/api.

**FADE IN:**

**Scene 1: The Chaos (0:00-0:10)**  
*Quick-cut montage: A stylized animated developer (diverse, mid-30s, wearing headphones) hunches over a laptop in a dimly lit home office. Code lines explode like fireworks on screen—red error bursts, wild AI outputs morph into cartoonish gremlins (playful, not scary) scrambling text and spitting gibberish like "ERROR: UNPREDICTABLE MAYHEM!" Camera: Rapid zooms and shaky pans for frenzy, glitch effects ripple across frame. Mood: Frustrating but humorous—exaggerated like a comedy sketch. SFX: Alarming beeps escalating to chaotic digital noise.*  

**VO (wry, exasperated):**  
"Tired of AI that turns your code into a circus? Hallucinations? Ghosted safeguards? We've all been there—building dreams, debugging nightmares."  

*On-screen text (terracotta, pulsing): "AI Gone Wild?"*

**Scene 2: The Turnaround (0:10-0:25)**  
*Cut to calm: Screen clears as Claude 3.5 Sonnet icon (sleek, glowing terracotta AI silhouette) "whispers" into the code—gremlins dissolve into neat, flowing lines. Developer leans back, relieved, typing seamlessly. Visuals: Real-time code refinement shown as a steerable dashboard (Constitutional AI visualized as glowing guide rails steering data streams). Camera: Smooth dolly-in on laptop, transitioning to steady tracking shot of dev's face lighting up. Mood: Empowering relief, like finding a lifeline. Music: Glitches fade to uplifting synth melody.*  

**VO (warm, confident):**  
"Meet Claude 3.5 Sonnet—your safe code companion. Powered by Constitutional AI, it listens, refines, and behaves. No drama, just efficient builds that cut risks and unlock new revenue streams."  

*On-screen text (clean overlay): "Steerable. Reliable. Revenue-Ready." Quick stat flash: "68% fewer ethical headaches."*

**Scene 3: The Win (0:25-0:40)**  
*Developer high-fives the screen (Claude icon "high-fives" back with a subtle animation). Screen glows with metrics: Graphs spike in green/terracotta—"Efficiency Up 30%, Risks Down." Cut to diverse dev team collaborating remotely, screens syncing flawlessly. Camera: Wide celebratory shot, then pull back to reveal Anthropic logo emerging from the code like light piercing fog. Mood: Triumphant, aspirational—building trust through shared success. SFX: Satisfying "ding" on metrics, light whoosh on logo.*  

**VO (energetic, inviting):**  
"From solo coders to teams, Claude's your co-pilot for smarter, safer AI. Build with confidence."  

*On-screen text: "Anthropic: AI You Can Trust."*

**Scene 4: Call to Action (0:40-0:45)**  
*Static hold on API button graphic pulsing invitingly. Fade to black with URL. Camera: Simple zoom on CTA elements. Mood: Direct, actionable. Music: Fades to empowering resolve.*  

**VO (clear, urgent):**  
"Integrate the Claude API today at anthropic.com/api."  

*On-screen text (bold Styrene A): "Get Started Now – anthropic.com/api" with QR code for mobile scan.*
